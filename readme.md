Weird behavior I noticed with sf::RenderWindow and sf::RenderTextures.

If I have antialiasing set on both window and render textures, and then draw the render textures to the window, the second render texture seemingly does not draw correctly. The correctness of the draw is also dependent on the order of display calls, check the code out to see an example, and check the video out to see what I expect the correct draw to look like. The portion of the screen to the left of the mouse is supposed to render as the left render texture, the right portion of the screen is supposed to be the right render texture, where the right render texture is tinted green to have a visual distinction since they're both loading from the same image... With the issue, the right render texture does not draw.
